DATA DICTIONARY of tidyDataSet

column1: subject
class: integer
information: Each number represents different subjects that involves
in this experiment.


column2: label
class: integer
information: Each number represents different activities that
the subject does, as following:
	1 walking
	2 walking upstairs	
	3 walking downstairs	
	4 sitting
	5 standing
	6 laying

column 3 to 68: features
class: numeric
information: The average value of features of data that are collected from each subject in each
activitiy. In this file, the features are selected are the feature
that involves mean and standard deviation calculation. names of 
the features are as following:
